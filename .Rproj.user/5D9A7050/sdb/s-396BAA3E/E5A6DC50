On June 27th the plane landed in Cape Town, and as I step in this new, unknown country I feel a sense of thrill in me! After such a long trip I am not only ready to explore the city and its surroundings areas, but I am also super excited to kick off with my new learning experience in Data Science and coding.\n\n# My first impressions\nI will not lie, my first impressions on Cape Town has been of a socially complex city. As I drive to my accommodation I see from far some townships, while I approach the richer areas. This is certainly something I will never forget.\nEveryone seems to be extremely friendly here, from my colleagues at iXperience to the locals. \n\n# First few shots of the city\n![Cape Town from Lion's Head](/Users/Paola/Downloads/heyhey2.jpeg)\n\n\n![My first time ##ZIP LINING##](/Users/Paola/Downloads/heyhey1.jpeg)",
