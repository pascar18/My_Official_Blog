<h2>My first time in Africa</h2>
<p>So here I am, for the first time in my life I am visiting Africa. On June 27th the plane landed in Cape Town, and as I step in this new, unknown country I feel a sense of thrill in me! After such a long trip I am not only ready to explore the city and its surroundings areas, but I am also super excited to kick off with my new learning experience in Data Science and coding.</p>

<h1>My first impressions</h1>
<p>I will not lie, my first impressions on Cape Town has been of a socially complex city. As I drive to my accommodation I see from far some townships, while I approach the richer areas. This is certainly something I will never forget. Everyone seems to be extremely friendly here, from my colleagues at iXperience to the locals.</p>
